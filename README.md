- This is a web application for music streaming built with React and Redux.

- The application also includes a music player with controls and playlist management features, as well as a sidebar with navigation menu for easy access to different sections of the application.

The application uses React Router for routing and Redux for state management, including the management of the player state. The application also uses custom components for the search bar, sidebar, music player, and top play section.
